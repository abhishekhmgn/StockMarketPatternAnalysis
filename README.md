# StockMarketPatternAnalysis
This is a program to figure out a pattern of stock market about when to buy or sell stocks.


" https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencsv/files/opencsv/ "
I am using the csv conversion library in this project, just for checking.
If you guys donâ€™t need this function, you can delete the toCSV method in the BigMain.
If you need, download the library in the link and add to the project.


I have added the data that I analyzed as "data.zip" expand the file and make sure you link the data in your project.
